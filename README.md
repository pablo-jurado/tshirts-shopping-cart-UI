Your Mission

##Recreate the following layout in HTML and CSS:

![GitHub Logo](https://tiy-learn-content.s3.amazonaws.com/988a985f-tshirts.gif)

##Normal Mode
PRIMARY

a multi-column layout that looks, structurally, the same as the layout shown in the gif.
a responsive layout. i.e., when the screen shrinks to tablet size, three columns should shrink to two. in phone size, all shirt boxes should stack in a single column.
SECONDARY

use advanced css selectors to create an interactive UI that responds to hovers or click behavior by users.
Adventure Mode
When a user clicks on the rotation icon at the top-right corner of a t-shirt box, the image of the t-shirt(s? hint hint) should rotate, showing the back of the shirt. Clicking again should return the front.
